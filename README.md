7. By default project supports gradle builds, in case you want to use Maven for builds you can generate a POM.xml as follows

        ./gradlew writeNewPom

8. A sample integration test is included in the project to demonstrate how to use a 3rd party REST api, as an example the API
exposed by the sample project is excersized. In order to run the integration tests do the following

	$./gradlew bootRun 

	open another window

	$./gradlew integrationTests
